\# Klipper Optimization: Dedicating CPU Cores on Windows with WSL



\## 1. Objective



This document outlines the process of assigning dedicated CPU cores to the Klipper 3D printing software running inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The primary goal is to prevent other Windows applications and system processes from interrupting Klipper's time-sensitive operations, which can help eliminate stuttering and ensure smooth, reliable printing.



This process is also known as setting \*\*CPU Affinity\*\*.



\## 2. System Context



\*   \*\*Host OS:\*\* Windows 11 Home

\*   \*\*CPU:\*\* Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz

&nbsp;   \*   Cores: 8

&nbsp;   \*   Logical Processors (Threads): 16 (CPU 0 to CPU 15)

\*   \*\*Klipper Environment:\*\* Running within WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).



\## 3. The "Why": Understanding the Process



Because Klipper is running inside WSL, it doesn't appear as a standard `python.exe` process in the Windows Task Manager. Instead, the entire WSL environment, including all its processes (Klippy, Moonraker, etc.), is managed by a single parent process on the Windows host.



This parent process is named \*\*`VmmemWSL`\*\*.



By setting the CPU affinity for `VmmemWSL`, we are telling the Windows scheduler to \*only\* run the entire Linux virtual machine on specific, dedicated CPU cores. This effectively isolates Klipper from the rest of the system.



\## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions



1\.  \*\*Open Task Manager:\*\* Press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` or right-click the Start Menu and select "Task Manager".



2\.  \*\*Navigate to the "Details" Tab:\*\* If you see a simplified view, first click "More details" at the bottom of the window.



3\.  \*\*Locate the `VmmemWSL` Process:\*\* Scroll down the list of processes and find `VmmemWSL`. This represents the resource usage of your active WSL instance.



4\.  \*\*Set CPU Affinity:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   Right-click on the `VmmemWSL` process.

&nbsp;   \*   From the context menu, select \*\*"Set affinity"\*\*.



5\.  \*\*Assign Dedicated Cores:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   A "Processor affinity" window will appear, showing all available logical processors (e.g., CPU 0 through CPU 15).

&nbsp;   \*   Uncheck the default \*\*`<All Processors>`\*\* option.

&nbsp;   \*   Select the cores you wish to dedicate. It is highly recommended to \*\*avoid CPU 0\*\* as it is heavily used by the Windows OS. Choosing high-numbered cores is a safe practice.

&nbsp;   \*   For this setup, \*\*CPU 14\*\* and \*\*CPU 15\*\* were selected.



&nbsp;   > \*\*Why two cores?\*\* While one core is sufficient for the main `klippy` service, the WSL environment also runs Moonraker, the web interface (Mainsail/Fluidd), and potentially a camera-streaming service. Assigning two cores provides one for Klipper's real-time needs and another for these supporting background tasks, ensuring maximum stability.



6\.  \*\*Confirm the Change:\*\* Click \*\*"OK"\*\*. The setting is now active.



\## 5. Important Consideration



\*\*This setting is temporary.\*\* The CPU affinity for `VmmemWSL` will be reset to all processors whenever the WSL service is restarted, which typically happens when you reboot your computer. This optimization must be manually re-applied after each reboot for it to remain in effect.
